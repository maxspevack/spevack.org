## Experience

### [CIQ](https://ciq.com/)
*(July 2025 - Present)*

**Senior Principal Linux Architect**  
**Chief of Staff to the CTO**

Acting as the strategic "fixer" for the CTO, re-architecting the engineering organization for velocity and accountability.

*   **Organizational Transformation:** Architected and executed the reorganization of Linux Engineering into "Core Distro" (OS) and "Release All Things" (Build Automation &amp; Delivery), clarifying accountability and accelerating release velocity.
*   **Turnaround Leadership:** Assumed control of the stalled "RAT" unit to resolve critical delivery failures. Restructured the team composition to establish a high-performance culture, unblocking pipelines and drastically reducing image build cycles for [Rocky Linux from CIQ](https://ciq.com/products/rocky-linux/) and [Google Distributed Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud-air-gapped). Handed over a stabilized, high-velocity organization to permanent Director.
*   **Strategic Planning:** Led 2026 resource planning and prioritization, implementing AI-driven reporting frameworks to provide executive visibility into engineering output.

### [Google](https://www.google.com/)
*(July 2021 - July 2023)*

**Senior Manager, [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) (Fleet)**

Directed the 50-person engineering organization responsible for the lifecycle and stability of the entire global GCE fleet.

*   **Culture Change:** Transformed the engineering culture toward proactive reliability by conceiving and implementing the "Mandatory Experiments" policy, significantly reducing fleet-wide regressions and rollback incidents.
*   **Enterprise Product Growth:** Designed and launched the "Stable Fleet" product line, securing key enterprise workloads by guaranteeing reduced change rates and managed maintenance windows.
*   **Customer Engineering:** Established a "White Glove" engineering tier for ultra-high-value customers, directly intervening to resolve complex kernel/virtualization blockers.

### [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
*(July 2019 - June 2021)*

**General Manager, [Amazon Linux](https://aws.amazon.com/linux/amazon-linux-2023/) &amp; [Open Source](https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/)**

Recruited to overhaul the Amazon Linux organization and OSPO. Scaled the team to 100+ engineers and product managers while redefining the product roadmap.

*   **Product Turnaround:** Delivered the roadmap and PR/FAQ for [Amazon Linux 2023](https://aws.amazon.com/linux/amazon-linux-2023/), defining the next generation of AWS's core operating system after a period of stagnation.
*   **Innovation:** Launched [Bottlerocket](https://bottlerocket.dev/) GA, a purpose-built open-source OS for container orchestration, capturing new workloads on EKS/ECS.
*   **Lifecycle Management:** Engineered the [extended support plan](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/update-on-amazon-ami-end-of-life/) for Amazon Linux 1, retaining critical legacy customer workloads while driving automated migration paths to Amazon Linux 2.
*   **Open Source Strategy:** Transformed the OSPO from a compliance bottleneck into a strategic enabler by launching the "Open Source Champions" program and automating legal reviews, reducing cycle time for code releases.

### [Google](https://www.google.com/)
*(February 2016 - June 2019)*

**Senior Manager, [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) (Virtualization)**

Led three engineering teams (KVM, Kernel Performance, Customer Experience) responsible for the core virtualization technology powering Google Cloud.

*   **Hardware Enablement:** Partnered with Intel/Nvidia to launch GCE support for [Skylake](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/compute-engine-updates-bring-skylake-ga-extended-memory-and-more-vm-flexibility)/[Cascade Lake](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/compute-engine-updates-bring-skylake-ga-extended-memory-and-more-vm-flexibility) CPUs and Tesla [V100](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/tesla-v100-gpus-are-now-generally-available)/[T4](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/efficiently-scale-ml-and-other-compute-workloads-on-nvidias-t4-gpu-now-generally-available) GPUs, unlocking new ML/AI revenue streams.
*   **Crisis Response:** Led the engineering response to [Spectre/Meltdown](https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/answering-your-questions-about-meltdown-and-spectre/) and [L1TF](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/protecting-against-the-new-l1tf-speculative-vulnerabilities), patching the massive GCE fleet with minimal customer disruption (Awarded Google "Feat of Engineering").
*   **Feature Engineering:** Delivered [Nested Virtualization](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/introducing-nested-virtualization-for) and SAP-certified large-memory instances ([ultramem](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/now-shipping-ultramem-machine-types-with-up-to-4tb-of-ram)), removing blockers for enterprise cloud migration (Awarded Google "Feat of Engineering").
